A simple memory based game using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery

When you press any key on the keyboard, the game begins.

At each level, the website will automatically show you a random colour.

You need to remember the sequence of the colours shown and click the buttons in the same sequence to move to the next level.

For example:

Level 1: The website shows blue. You click blue. Correct, so you proceed to the next level.

Level 2: The website shows red. Now one must click the blue and red buttons (in that order) to go to the next level.

Level 3: The website shows green. The player must now click the blue, red, and green buttons to proceed to the next level.

Level 4: The website shows green again. The player must now click the blue, red, green, and green buttons to proceed to the next level.
And so onâ€¦

As the level increases, the game becomes difficult as the player needs to remember the correct sequence from the beginning and click the buttons accordingly.

If the player clicks a wrong-coloured button, the game ends, and the player can restart the game from level 1 again by pressing any key.

# Tech stacks used in the website:
In this website, I have used HTML to layout the contents and CSS to style my web page.
I have used Javascript to write the game's logic, which gives functionality to the web page.
I have also used jQuery in order to simplify some of the Javascript coding.
